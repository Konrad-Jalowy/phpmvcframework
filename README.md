# Project info
Ive done this project long time ago. Im better and more experienced coder right now. Im also in completely new stack right now and PHP is not even my first language (but ill always say its great, fun, theres nothing better than backend in Laravel or even pure PHP for fun). 

Right now, as i side project i work on better version of this project. As a warmup i create standalone components (in different versions) and then ill think how to combine it into one, great project.


This project is very, very good though. Here i decided to write down its strong points. Oftentimes were being asked for github link and some project links but then nobody checks those projects or they all make their mind judging by readme.md and some random file. If youre not one of those people, just check this project. Its good, 3 other (not mine) projects combined + my own input (i will highlight my best parts below).

So if youre not one of those people, just check this project out. And if you are one of those people, keep reading and feel entitled to judge my abilities by how i present myself on the paper and in readmemd. I apologize if i made you use google translate or something, but i made sure to mess up punctuaction here and there and not to use overcompicated, verbose vocabulary, so we can still be friends i guess :) 

Heres main strong parts of the project that were made BY ME, FROM SCRATCH, highlighted for your own convenience:
- **Templating engine** - ive done my own and if i recall correctly it is here, its better than templating engines in other project (not mine). Also i did some BBCode parser but it never end up in final project.
- **Session counting active users** - yes, i basically check the sess temp files, then i check if they were modified/accessed in last 5 minutes, then i add middleware to every request that does some action that results in modification of session file
- **Helper functions** - really great job with the helpers, i was kinda inspired by the Laravel framework (not all helpers ended up in the final project)
- **Almost has ORM** - in none of those 3 projects (not mine) we had something even remotely resembling ORM. And yes, creating ORM and migration mechanism is a project itself and even more challenging that MVC framework. Still, i created model class and there is such deal, that you create your own sql tables but then you can inherit from model class and basically you input table rows (their names) in one place and basically you use it as if it was Laravel

Thank you for reading this humble readme, your interest means a world to me... Im currently working at better mvc php projects and those projects are completely side-projects, im in totally new stack (but i still miss LAMP... like it or not, its so much fun!)


## my php mvc framework
long time no see. I did 3 other (that is not mine) mvc php frameworks projects. Then i combined them all and added some things from myself and created this


Right now im back to coding in PHP (in my free time). This means, i will try to do a better framework while learning/using other languages and frameworks 


But hey, thats old and pretty good project ive done. Right now im re-doing some standalone parts of a framework (templating engine, router and so on) and trying to find best piecies to combine in one, great, php-written mvc framework project.


But this project is something ive done long time ago and im absolutely proud of myself and how i managed to understand it and get it work (even tho right now idve done it faster and better). 


So yeah, its an mvc project, but not the latest one, the old one (thats just an info if some company wanted to really read my cv and check the github as they claim... they usually give HR to people who doesnt know anyting about it and some language models and im not sure if im even willing to work in someone else office anymore with the fullstack knowledge i have, but hey, if youre reading this and are impressed with this project, im just informing you its the old one and in coding language that is neither first nor main right now, there are better projects in my portfolio and there are better projects coming, stay tuned!)
